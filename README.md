30.11.2020 UPDATE after two (I guess) days. The site looks just as I want. I decided to make Ukranian version of the site. The Google i see every day. So if you are curious how Google looks like in Ukraine - you are welcome. I intentionally didn't make "zoom" icon and mike at the search bar. I left it to the end of the project, and in the end it turnder out too hard to implement, because i made my search bar and other parts not the way Google did. I tried, but then decided to spend my time to make the site more respinsive, cause i think it is more useful. Next comes the hard version
